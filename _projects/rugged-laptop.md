title: "Rugged laptop"

I see a lot of rugged computers at work, some with specialized functions in large pelican cases, while some are Rugged laptops by OEMs. I wanna try building one so with the old laptop I have lying around, just for fun, no specific purpose(well maybe in the future we could use it as a RC ground station).

## What we have on hand
I have an old laptop lying around that has its frame broken, but everything should be working fine. This should be a convenient project where I put the motherboard in the pelican case with some mounts and cooling, and put the screen on top. The keyboard is mounted on the laptop frame so we are not gonna deal with that, opting for a USB keyboard setup. For mouse, I will be going for a joystick mouse

Things I have:
- Laptop
- Charger
- Joystick mouse (from an Arduino joystick and ESP board)

Things I need to buy for this project
- Rugged Case capable big enough for motherboard
- Axial fan for intake cooling
- Turbine fan for exhaust cooling
- Heat sinks to replace the custom heat pipes of the original laptop
- USB HUB

as a student, I`m broke af, and therefore the project pauses here
waiting for next payday to buy the pelican case, staytuned!
