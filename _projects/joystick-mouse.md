This mini project is made for the [rugged laptop project](/projects/rugged-laptop)
Mouse is not so convinient in variable outdoor conditions, and a trackball is kinda expensive (╯︵╰,)

So using arduino sensor and a esp controller, I followed the tutorials and put together a joystick mouse

It works ok, but esp has too much power for a small project like this, Ill probably use something less powerful when I put up my Rugged laptop
