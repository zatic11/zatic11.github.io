Welcome! you`ve found the place where I try to document things of interest that I'm into (mainly in my spare time), so I have stuff to show when others ask about me(*≧ω≦*)

This site is still under early construction so things get updated whenever I have the time!

## About Me

Hello, I am Zatic11, and I will soon be obtaining a bachelor's in EEE and joining the workforce soon. Recently, I`ve discovered that the local library has a makerspace available and thus been spending most of my free time here. 

As I slowly learn to build this blog, I will also document some of my personal projects and other fun stuff. 
My interests may change over time, but right now, I am interested in Retro Handheld devices, Coffee, RC vehicles. 

So check out my posts below! 	( ´ ω ` )ノﾞ
