Welcome! You`ve found the place where I try to document things of interest that I'm into (mainly in my spare time), so I can look back and feel like I've done something(*≧ω≦*)

This site is still under early construction, so things get updated whenever I have the time! 

## About Me

Hello, I am Zatic11, EEE trained and joining the workforce soon. Recently, I`ve discovered that the local library has a makerspace available and thus have been spending most of my free time here. 

As I slowly learn to build this blog, I will also document some of my personal projects and other fun stuff. 
My interests may change over time, but right now, I am interested in Retro Handheld devices, Coffee, RC vehicles. 

So check out my posts below! 	( ´ ω ` )ノﾞ

Just choose a category!
